The ggswim package provides an easy set of commands to create "swimmer" plots.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ggswim like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("CHOP-CGTInformatics/ggswim")
```

## Example

Below is a simple example for how to set up your "swim table" to pass along to `ggswim()`:

```{r load_package and data, eval=TRUE}
library(ggswim)

df <- tibble::tribble(
  ~subject_id, ~time, ~event,
  1, 0, "Infusion",
  1, 2, "CRS Grade 1",
  1, 3, "CRS Grade 2",
  1, 4, "CRS Grade 1",
  1, 5, "No CRS",
  1, 6, "Last Follow Up",
  2, 0, "Infusion",
  2, 1, "CRS Grade 1",
  2, 4, "CRS Grade 2",
  2, 7, "CRS Grade 1",
  2, 8, "No CRS",
  2, 9, "Last Follow Up",
  3, 0, "Infusion",
  3, 1, "CRS Grade 1",
  3, 2, "CRS Grade 2",
  3, 3, "CRS Grade 4",
  3, 7, "CRS Grade 5",
  3, 10, "Death"
)

df
```

We'll also pre-define some arguments of interest and the plot accordingly:

```{r ggswim, eval=TRUE}
lanes <- c("CRS Grade 1", 
           "CRS Grade 2", 
           "CRS Grade 3", 
           "CRS Grade 4", 
           "CRS Grade 5", 
           "No CRS")

lane_colors = c("yellow", "orange", "pink", "red", "black", "gray")

markers <- list(
  "Last Follow Up" = "👤", 
  "Death" = "❌",  
  "Infusion" = "🏥"
)

df |>
  ggswim(id = subject_id,
         time = time,
         events = event,
         reference_event = "Infusion",
         emoji_or_shape = "emoji",
         markers = markers,
         lanes = lanes,
         lane_colors = lane_colors,
         title = "My Swim Plot",
         xlab = "Time",
         ylab = "Subject ID",
         legend_title = "My Legend Title")
```
