The ggswim package provides a convenient set of commands to easily create swimmer plots. It integrates with the familiar ggplot2 framework and streamlines the process of generating legends that effectively communicate events of interest along individual subject trajectories.  

## Installation

You can install the development version of ggswim like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("CHOP-CGTInformatics/ggswim")
```

## Usage

To help you get started, ggswim includes three sample datasets: `patient_data`, `infusion_events`, and `end_study_events`. These de-identified datasets simulate real world data related to infusions, disease assessments, and study statuses for a clinical trial.

By first calling the `ggswim()` function, we can set up the horizontal survival bars of our swimmer plot, i.e. the "lanes:"

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggswim)
library(ggplot2)

p <- ggswim(
  patient_data,
  mapping = aes(x = delta_t0_months, y = pt_id, fill = disease_assessment),
  arrow = arrow_status,
  arrow_head_length = unit(.25, "inches"),
  arrow_neck_length = delta_today,
  width = 0.25
)
```

Next we'll add on events of interest: end of study updates, and infusions. These we'll refer to as "markers":

```{r, message=FALSE}
p <- p +
  add_marker(
    data = end_study_events |> dplyr::rename("Status Markers" = end_study_name),
    aes(x = delta_t0_months, y = pt_id, label_vals = end_study_label, label_names = `Status Markers`),
    label.size = NA, fill = NA, size = 5
  ) +
  add_marker(
    data = infusion_events,
    aes(x = delta_t0_months, y = pt_id, name = "Infusion"), color = "#25DA6D",
    size = 5, position = "identity", alpha = .75
  ) 
```

Finally, we'll beautify the plot with familiar ggplot2 techniques and a last finishing touch with `theme_ggswim()`:

```{r, message=FALSE}
p +
  scale_fill_manual(
    name = "Overall Disease Assessment",
    values = c("#6394F3", "#F3C363", "#EB792F")
  ) +
  labs(title = "My Swimmer Plot") +
  xlab("Time Since Infusion (Months)") + ylab("Patient ID") +
  theme_ggswim()
```
