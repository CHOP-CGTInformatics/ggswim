The ggswim package provides an easy set of commands to create "swimmer" plots.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ggswim like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("CHOP-CGTInformatics/ggswim")
```

## Example

Below is a simple example for how to set up your "swim table" to pass along to `ggswim()`:

```{r load_package and data, eval=TRUE, results='hide'}
library(ggswim)

df <- tibble::tribble(
  ~subject_id, ~time, ~event,
  1, 0, "Infusion",
  1, 2, "CRS Grade 1",
  1, 3, "CRS Grade 2",
  1, 4, "CRS Grade 1",
  1, 5, "No CRS",
  1, 6, "Last Follow Up",
  2, 0, "Infusion",
  2, 1, "CRS Grade 1",
  2, 4, "CRS Grade 2",
  2, 7, "CRS Grade 1",
  2, 8, "No CRS",
  2, 9, "Last Follow Up",
  3, 0, "Infusion",
  3, 1, "CRS Grade 1",
  3, 2, "CRS Grade 2",
  3, 3, "CRS Grade 4",
  3, 7, "CRS Grade 5",
  3, 10, "Death"
)

df
```

We'll also pre-define some arguments of interest and the plot accordingly. To showcase the different ways you can supply `markers` and `lanes` to `ggswim()`, we'll show a few examples together:

```{r ggswim, eval=TRUE}
lanes = list(
  "No CRS" = "gray",
  "CRS Grade 1" = "yellow",
  "CRS Grade 2" = "orange",
  "CRS Grade 3" = "pink",
  "CRS Grade 4" = "red",
  "CRS Grade 5" = "black"
)

markers_emoji <- list(
  "Last Follow Up" = "👤",
  "Death" = "❌",
  "Infusion" = "🏥"
)

plot1 <- df |>
  ggswim(id = subject_id,
         time = time,
         events = event,
         reference_event = "Infusion",
         markers = markers_emoji,
         lanes = lanes,
         legend_title = c("My Lanes Legend", "My Markers Legend")) +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "My Swim Plot with Emojis", x = "Time", y = "Subject ID")

markers_shape <- list(
  "Last Follow Up" = 21,
  "Death" = 4,
  "Infusion" = 6
)

unnamed_lanes = list(
  "No CRS",
  "CRS Grade 1",
  "CRS Grade 2",
  "CRS Grade 3",
  "CRS Grade 4",
  "CRS Grade 5"
)

plot2 <- df |>
  ggswim(id = subject_id,
         time = time,
         events = event,
         reference_event = "Infusion",
         markers = markers_shape,
         lanes = unnamed_lanes,
         legend_title = c("My Lanes Legend", "My Markers Legend")) +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "My Swim Plot with Shapes", x = "Time", y = "Subject ID")
```

The first plot (top) shows `markers` defined by emojis, with `lanes` assigned user-defined colors. The second plot (bottom) shows `markers` defined by [ggplot shapes](https://r-graphics.org/recipe-scatter-shapes#discussion-28) and `lanes` with no color designation. In this case, default ggplot colors are assigned.

```{r plot1}
plot1 +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "My Swim Plot", x = "Time", y = "Subject ID") +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal()
```

```{r plot2}
plot2 +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "My Swim Plot", x = "Time", y = "Subject ID") +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal()
```

One key thing to note is that lanes and markers are ordered as factors in the order they are received. Additionally, the first lane specifier is considered the default to be used in the absence of lane data in the event stream. Notice how "No CRS" is assigned at the beginning of the swim lanes even though it is not defined here in the original `df`.
