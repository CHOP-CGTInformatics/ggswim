The ggswim package provides a convenient set of commands to easily create "swimmer" plots.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ggswim like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("CHOP-CGTInformatics/ggswim")
```

## ggswim: Elegant Swimmer Plots with ggplot2

ggswim simplifies the creation of stunning swimmer plots by seamlessly integrating with the familiar ggplot2 framework, allowing developers to effortlessly add layers and customize displays to their needs.

One of ggswim's key strengths is its ability to streamline the process of generating clear, reproducible legends. This ensures that crucial points of interest are effectively communicated, enhancing the narrative of the swimmer plot.

Let's dive right into a quick example to showcase the simplicity and effectiveness of ggswim!

## Exploring the Sample Dataset

To help you get started, ggswim includes a sample dataset named `patient_status`. This dataset comprises three tibbles:

- `patient_status`: Designed for ease of use with ggswim, it may not perfectly mirror real-world data, but serves as an ideal starting point. A 7 column tibble with subject cohorts, statuses, and start and end times.
- `adverse_events`: A 3 column tibble showcasing 3 kinds of adverse events and the time when they occurred
- `medication_administration`: A 4 column tibble showcasing 2 kinds of medications and the time they were given

You can also access each of these tibbles individually. Let's load the data and dive into creating our swimmer plots!

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggswim)

ggswim(
  data = patient_status,
  mapping = aes(
    x = value,
    y = subject_id,
    fill = cohort
  )
) +
  add_marker(
    data = adverse_events,
    mapping = aes(
      x = time_of_event,
      y = subject_id,
      color = adverse_event_name,
      shape = adverse_event_name
    ),
    size = 5
  ) +
  add_marker(
    data = medication_administration,
    mapping = aes(
      x = time_of_event,
      y = subject_id,
      label = medication,
      color = name
    ),
    label.size = NA, fill = NA, size = 5
  ) +
  ggplot2::labs(x = "Time", y = "Subject ID", color = "Markers") +
  ggplot2::ggtitle("My Swim Plot") +
  ggplot2::scale_color_manual(
    name = "Markers",
    values = c("firebrick", "forestgreen", NA, NA, "purple")
  ) +
  ggplot2::scale_shape_manual(
    name = "Markers",
    values = c(19, 13, 9)
  ) +
  ggplot2::scale_fill_manual(
    name = "Lanes",
    values = c("steelblue1", "goldenrod1")
  ) +
  theme_ggswim()
```
